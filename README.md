#Blackjack Advisor

####Tired of losing all your money at the blackjack table in Vegas?
Next time, bring along your laptop, open up the terminal, and run `blackjack_advisor.rb`.
You'll be swimming in cash before you know it.  Here's how:

1. Enter the values of your first two cards one at a time
  * for face cards, enter the first letter: `[A, K, Q, J]`
  * Blackjack Advisor cannot read any other values and will prompt you to try again if there's any funny business
  
2. Enter the value of the dealer's face-up card

3. Blackjack Advisor will return your optimal move based on the probabilities calculated by the 
[Wizard of Odds](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/calculator/).

4. Blindly follow Blackjack Advisor's instructions. Possible moves include the following:
  * Hit
  * Stand
  * Split
  * Double (if possible), or Hit
  * Double (if possible), or Stand
  
5. Repeat until rich*
